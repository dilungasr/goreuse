	Use:   "goreuse",
	Short: "Replace module names and everything you need to reuse your project",
	Long: `Go Reuse provides a simple way to reuse your project to create a new project with 
	some little changes.

- Replacing your module package name to all files in your project so you don't
mess with manual work of updating the imports to refer to the new package
name. 
- Global replacement to any text in your codes
- You can exclude files 
- You can specify the target extensions

Don't start from scratch, don't get stressed...
Just reuse it :)
