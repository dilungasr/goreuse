# reuse

Reuse provides a simple way to automate changes to be made on your current project folder so you can reuse it for the next project.

- Perform project-wise replacement to any text in your code
- Automate your project setup commands
- Delete files you don't want in the next project
- Specify extensions to modify contents on
- Ignore files you don't want to modify
- Use terminal interactive mode or define everying in config file
- Supports yaml, toml and json... There you have it! 

Don't start from scratch, don't get stressed...
Just reuse it :)

Much love from Tanzania!
