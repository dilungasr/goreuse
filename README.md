#Go Reuse

Go Reuse provides a simple way to reuse your project to create a new project with
some little changes.

  mess with manual work of updating the imports to refer to the new package
  name.
- Global replacement to any text in your codes
- You can exclude files
- You can specify the target extensions
- Automate the commands to be run afte rupdating your project

Don't start from scratch, don't get stressed...
Just reuse it :)
